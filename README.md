# Arduino Control App 🤖

A React Native app built with Expo for controlling Arduino devices via Bluetooth. This project uses Expo's development build to support native Bluetooth capabilities.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **Xcode** (for iOS development - Mac only)
- **Android device or emulator** with Bluetooth
- **Arduino board** with Bluetooth module (HC-05, HC-06, or BLE)

## 📦 Installation

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the development app (first time only)

   **For Android:**
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

   **For iOS (Mac only):**
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

   > **Note:** The first build takes 5-10 minutes. This installs a custom development build on your device with native Bluetooth support.

3. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Then press `a` for Android or `i` for iOS to launch the app.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- **`app/`** - Application screens and navigation (Expo Router)
  - `(tabs)/` - Tab-based navigation screens
  - `_layout.tsx` - Root layout with theme provider
  - `modal.tsx` - Example modal screen
- **`components/`** - Reusable UI components
- **`hooks/`** - Custom React hooks
- **`constants/`** - App-wide constants (colors, themes)
- **`assets/`** - Images and static resources
- **`android/`** - Native Android code (auto-generated)

## 🎯 Development Build vs Expo Go

This app uses **Expo Development Build** instead of Expo Go because:
- ✅ Supports native Bluetooth libraries
- ✅ Can add custom native modules
- ✅ Full access to device capabilities
- ✅ Still maintains fast refresh and Expo development experience

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the development server with dev client
- `npm run android` - Build and run on Android
- `npm run ios` - Build and run on iOS
- `npm run web` - Run on web browser
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run reset-project` - Reset to blank template
